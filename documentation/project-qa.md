# Project Q&A

## 1. Does the dashboard have a structured interface for coaches to log session notes, which the chatbot can reference in future conversations?

✅ **Yes**, the dashboard will have a structured interface where coaches can log:
- Session notes  
- User progress  
- Feedback  

These notes will be stored in a database and referenced dynamically by the chatbot for personalized interactions in future conversations.

---

## 2. Does the chatbot store past interactions dynamically and retrieve key insights in context for ongoing conversations?

✅ **Yes**, the chatbot will:
- Store past interactions  
- Dynamically retrieve key insights  
- Maintain conversation history to enable contextual and relevant responses based on previous discussions  

---

## 3. What level of flexibility is included in the existing scope before extra costs apply?

The existing scope includes:

- ✅ UI and dashboard development  
- ✅ Chatbot integration with GPT and KakaoTalk  
- ✅ Knowledge base setup for coaches  
- ✅ Basic reporting and insights  
- ✅ Standard testing and deployment  

🔄 **Minor refinements** within the first month post-deployment are included.

❗**Extra costs** apply for:
- Major UI changes  
- Third-party tool integrations  
- Extensive chatbot re-training  

Costs will be assessed based on complexity.

## 4. Is there a structured plan for testing & troubleshooting to ensure readiness by May for data collection?

✅ **Yes**, the plan includes:

**Phase 1: Internal Testing**  
- Chatbot logic  
- Dashboard features  
- Data storage  

**Phase 2: User Testing**  
- Small group internal testing  

**Phase 3: Final Debugging & Optimization**  
- Addressing user feedback  
- Fixing bugs  
- Ensuring performance stability  

📅 This approach ensures system readiness for **May data collection**.

---

## 5. For post-deployment support: Does this include bug fixes only, or also minor refinements based on early user feedback?

✅ **Post-deployment support includes:**

- 🐞 **Bug fixes**: Technical errors in chatbot, dashboard, or API integrations  
- 🔧 **Minor refinements**: UI tweaks, chatbot response tuning, text modifications  

❗ Major feature additions or new integrations will require a separate cost assessment.

---

## 6. If an additional feature is added for 1:1 human coaching session scheduling and online meeting execution to be conducted directly on the website, how can it be implemented? Also, how much extra cost is needed?

🛠️ To implement this feature:
- Integrate scheduling tools (e.g., **Google Calendar API**, **Calendly**, or custom scheduler)  
- Enable direct video calls via **Zoom SDK**  
- Allow coaches to set availability and users to book sessions through the dashboard  

💰 **Estimated Additional Cost**:  
**$2000 - $2500**, depending on complexity and integration requirements

---

## 7. Explicitly mention that the language must be supported in both Korean and English.

🌐 **Yes**, full bilingual support will be implemented:

- 🗣️ **Chatbot**: Dynamic support for both Korean and English  
- 🖥️ **Dashboard**: Language-switching options for coaches
